This project was a lot of fun to work on (maybe too much fun) because I played around with different front end frameworks and react component structures.

I used bootstrap 4 for the mobile responsiveness and used class based components to handle state.  I also created dumb-components to handle resusable renderings if possible.


Thank you for taking the time to look through this repo and I would appreciate all constructive feedback!

# Still to do:

fix the drop down from selecting wrong color

The page is mobile responsive however still needs to be worked on for larger screens.

Half way through I realized I wasn't happy with class based components so I created a new branch which is being developed using react hooks.  The idea is to get state information off the product page and use getters and setter functionality to handle state in app.js.

Have description and detail be marked as active when clicked on and have a bottom border for the active.
