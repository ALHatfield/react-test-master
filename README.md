# Still to do:

fix the drop down from selecting wrong color

The page is mobile responsive however still needs to be worked on for larger screens.

Half way through I realized I wasn't happy with class based components so I created a new branch which is being developed using react hooks.  The idea is to get state information off the product page and use getters and setter functionality to handle state in app.js.

Have description and detail be marked as active when clicked on and have a bottom border for the active.
